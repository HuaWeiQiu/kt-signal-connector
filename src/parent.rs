//! Launcher (desktop) liveness and data-directory ownership, the connector
//! side of the orphan-process repair (P0 + P1 of the zombie-reclaim batch).
//!
//! Why this exists: the engine self-exits on stdin EOF, but that EOF only
//! happens when the connector's own stdin closes — a connector whose launcher
//! died with SIGKILL has no EOF for the child and no EOF of its own. The
//! desktop's killOrphanConnectors used to run only at startup, so a hard-killed
//! Electron could leave a connector (+engine) holding this data directory:
//!
//! 1. **P0 parent watch** — the connector records the launcher pid (`--parent-pid`
//!    on every platform, or the pid it was started from, or the pid in this
//!    module's ownership marker written by the launcher), probes it every
//!    `PARENT_POLL_INTERVAL`, and when it is gone it tears the runtime down
//!    (which is what carries the engine children with it) and exits. Linux
//!    and macOS re-parent an orphaned child to pid 1, so the probe also
//!    treats a *changed* `getppid()` as death even while the old pid still
//!    answers (pid reuse).
//! 2. **P0 orphan-engine sweep** — the supervisor's periodic pass also looks
//!    at every engine process that names this data directory and terminates
//!    the ones that were re-parented to pid 1: an orphan engine is one whose
//!    connector died, and it keeps the account database open. Engines this
//!    process owns are excluded by pid, and the "who spawned me" probe is
//!    the last gate before a signal.
//! 3. **P1 ownership marker** — `serve` leaves `pid` + start timestamp in
//!    `OWNER_FILE_NAME` inside the data directory. A replacement connector
//!    whose launcher did not pass `--parent-pid` adopts a marker written
//!    within `OWNER_MARKER_FRESH` (an immediate restart racing the old
//!    generation) and rewrites it for its own generation. The marker is
//!    bookkeeping only: occupancy stays the kernel lock's business
//!    (`datalock`), and a marker failure never fails a start.
//!
//! Hard boundary: every decision below is scoped to processes whose argv
//! names **this** data directory (`--signal-data-dir <dir>`, the engine's
//! `--data-dir <dir>`, the per-account `.../engines/<accountId>` slots
//! beneath it). Nothing here ever signals a pid it has not positively
//! classified, nothing is logged beyond pids and fixed reason literals, and
//! the sweep records rather than kills whenever the evidence is not
//! unambiguous.
//!
//! macOS note: `ps -Ao args` truncates at MAXCOMLEN, so the data-directory
//! argument is usually missing there. The argv evidence for this data
//! directory is therefore taken from the kernel's own process arguments
//! (`KERN_PROCARGS2` via `sysctl`), where pids are matched but never logged.
