//! Multi-group runtime facade (ADR 0001 R6-R9): one connector process, one
//! supervised signal-cli engine per launcher-defined proxy group. Sibling
//! connector processes on the same host are legal under the ADR 0002
//! namespace rules — disjoint endpoints and data directories (enforced by
//! the startup occupancy lock in `crate::datalock`) plus a per-instance
//! state-dir store; nothing inside this facade assumes it is the only
//! connector on the machine.
//!
//! The facade owns every [`RuntimeSupervisor`] in launcher configuration order
//! and is the only surface the host protocol talks to. Its responsibilities,
//! pinned by implementation-plan §4.4:
//!
//! - `runtime.*` results carry the pre-Phase-4 top-level aggregate plus the
//!   additive `proxyGroups[]` array. The aggregation rule is fixed: `running`
//!   if any group runs, else `faulted`, else `exited`, else `stopped`;
//!   `rssBytes` sums live samples; pressure ORs across groups; the top-level
//!   `pid` exists only when exactly one group exists — so a single-group
//!   deployment is field-for-field identical to Phase 3.
//! - Account-addressed methods route by the account's stored binding.
//! - Link flows are per group (`LINK_IN_PROGRESS` and restarts never cross
//!   group boundaries); unknown groups fail closed with
//!   `PROXY_GROUP_NOT_FOUND`.
//! - Per-group engine transitions fan out as `proxyGroup.stateChanged` while
//!   `runtime.stateChanged` keeps carrying the aggregate shape unchanged.
