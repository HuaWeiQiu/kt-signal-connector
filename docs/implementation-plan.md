# KT Signal Connector Implementation Plan

## 1. Status

- Decision date: 2026-08-04
- Current status: Connector Phases 1–3 are implemented locally; the separate KT Desktop Phase 4
  integration is locally merged at `5e18793c`, while production Phase 3 exit gates remain open
- Connector source baseline: `main` @ `6656f70`
- Target engine baseline: unmodified `signal-cli v0.14.7`
- Target Java baseline: JRE 25
- Initial platforms: Windows 10/11 x64, macOS x64, macOS arm64
- Remote publication: not authorized yet; all work remains local until testing and review are complete

This document is the standalone implementation plan for `kt-signal-connector`. KT Desktop owns the
product UI and business features; this repository owns the isolated local transport, process,
storage, and normalized message boundary.

## 2. Delivery Decision

The production process model is:

```text
closed-source KT Desktop
        |
        | authenticated, versioned local IPC
        v
open-source kt-signal-connector (Rust)
        |
        | stdin/stdout JSON-RPC 2.0
        v
unmodified signal-cli + JRE 25
        |
        v
Signal service
```

Per local KT profile the fixed process count is:

```text
1 x kt-signal-connector
1 x signal-cli JVM
N x Signal accounts
M x conversations
```

Accounts and conversations do not create processes. One ordinary text conversation is expected to
add only its bounded UI/message window in KT; it does not consume a separate JVM or 1 GB of memory.

## 3. Ownership Boundaries

### 3.1 KT Desktop

KT Desktop owns:

- Signal account, conversation, message, and composer UI.
- AI reply, target-language policy, translation, remarks, and quick replies.
- Renderer-to-main-process allowlisted IPC.
- Connector artifact download, signature verification, activation, and last-known-good rollback.
- Tenant capability and product rollout switches.

KT Desktop must not own:

- signal-cli process protocol parsing.
- Signal account keys or protocol databases.
- raw signal-cli envelopes.
- connector source or AGPL dependencies linked into its executable.

### 3.2 Connector

The connector owns:

- authenticated local IPC and API version negotiation.
- signal-cli child process lifecycle and JSON-RPC request matching.
- link flow state and QR secret lifetime.
- raw-envelope validation and normalization.
- stable message IDs, deduplication, SQLite indexes, cursors, and bounded caches.
- attachment metadata and any approved file-handle boundary.
- runtime health, RSS/CPU monitoring, redacted diagnostics, and engine restart policy.

The connector must not:

- render UI or accept arbitrary renderer connections.
- execute unrestricted KT feature code.
- expose arbitrary signal-cli JSON-RPC methods.
- expose raw envelopes, data-directory paths, account keys, or arbitrary file paths.
- link or copy signal-cli/libsignal source.

### 3.3 signal-cli

signal-cli exclusively owns:

- Signal protocol and cryptography.
- linked-device account state and keys.
- upstream websocket communication.
- Signal-specific send and receive behavior.

The first release uses an unmodified, pinned upstream artifact. A required upstream patch is a new
architecture and license review, not a routine implementation detail.

## 4. API Boundary

### 4.1 Transport

- Windows: a random per-start named pipe restricted to the current user SID.
- macOS/Linux: a socket in a profile-private directory with mode `0600`.
- No public listener and no fixed localhost HTTP/TCP port.
- The renderer never receives the endpoint or the session secret.

Electron Main creates a 256-bit random bootstrap secret in an owner-only temporary file, starts the
connector with the file path, and the connector reads and deletes the file before accepting a
client. The first frame performs a challenge-response handshake and negotiates API capabilities.
The secret and endpoint are never logged.

The secret file contains exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters. The server sends a random
32-byte hexadecimal `serverNonce`; KT answers with a random 32-byte hexadecimal `clientNonce` and:

```text
proof = hex(HMAC-SHA256(secret,
  "kt-signal-connector-v1\0" + serverNonce + "\0" + clientNonce + "\0" + apiVersion))
```

Nonces and proofs must be canonical lowercase hex. Authentication has a five-second deadline and a
connection is closed after any malformed or failed handshake. Phase 1 supports exactly API `1.0`.

### 4.2 Framing

The initial host protocol uses newline-delimited JSON with explicit maximum frame size. Each request
contains:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "1.0",
  "requestId": "opaque-id",
  "method": "runtime.status",
  "params": {}
}
```

A response contains exactly one of `result` or `error`. Events have no request ID and use a separate
`event` field. Unknown fields are ignored only when the negotiated minor version permits them;
unknown methods are rejected.

### 4.3 Initial allowlist

Phase 2 host methods:

- `handshake`
- `runtime.status`
- `runtime.start`
- `runtime.stop`
- `accounts.list`
- `accounts.deleteLocalData`
- `link.start`
- `link.finish`
- `link.cancel`
- `conversations.list`
- `messages.list`
- `messages.sendText`
- normalized runtime/account/conversation/message events

No generic `call`, `exec`, `jsonRpc`, file-read, URL-open, or raw-envelope endpoint is allowed.
The machine-readable Phase 2 envelope contract is
[`schemas/connector-api-v1.schema.json`](../schemas/connector-api-v1.schema.json). Methods outside this
allowlist return `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`. Media and bulk automation remain unavailable.

## 5. signal-cli Boundary

The connector starts multi-account JSON-RPC mode without `-a`:

```text
signal-cli --data-dir <profile-private-data-dir> jsonRpc
```

Rules:

- executable path, data directory, JRE arguments, and environment come from a signed runtime
  manifest, never from an IPC request.
- stdin writes one JSON-RPC object per line.
- stdout is incrementally parsed with a hard line-size limit.
- response IDs are matched to a bounded pending map.
- `method=receive` is normalized as an event.
- stderr is redacted diagnostic input, never protocol input.
- read-only requests may be retried under policy; mutating requests are never retried automatically
  after an unknown outcome.
- child shutdown is graceful first, then forced after a fixed deadline.

During the local Phase 1 PoC, the trusted launcher supplies absolute executable and data-directory
paths as process arguments; neither is accepted over host IPC. Phase 3 replaces this bootstrap with
signed runtime-manifest verification before packaging acceptance.

## 6. Linking and Messaging

### 6.1 Linking

`link.start` calls signal-cli `startLink`. The raw device-link URI remains only in connector memory.
KT receives a short-lived session ID and the QR payload needed for display. `link.finish` resolves the
session ID internally and calls `finishLink`; KT cannot supply or alter the raw URI.

One profile permits one active link flow. `link.finish` uses its own single-capacity wait lane so a
five-minute phone-approval wait cannot block runtime control, `link.start`, or `link.cancel`.
Duplicate finish calls are rejected instead of accumulating pending requests.

Cancellation is linearized before it returns: a cancelled or superseded finish result cannot create
an account row or emit `account.changed`. The pinned signal-cli JSON-RPC API has no operation that
cancels an already-dispatched `finishLink`; when `link.cancel` finds one in flight, the connector
restarts the one shared signal-cli engine after clearing the link session. This does not delete or
unlink existing accounts, but it can briefly pause every Signal account in the same local profile.
KT must therefore reuse an unexpired QR and perform this restart only for an explicit replacement,
not an automatic render retry.

Cancellation, timeout, client disconnect, or connector shutdown zeroizes and removes the state. QR
data is never stored or logged.

### 6.2 Local account exit

`accounts.deleteLocalData` accepts an `accountId`; current KT versions also send a stable generated
`operationId`. The field remains optional in API 1.0 so a Connector upgrade does not break an older
Desktop, but new Desktop code must persist and reuse it. The operation removes only that account's
signal-cli data and Connector rows; it must not clear or replace the profile's active link session.
Connector row deletion is one SQLite transaction and is idempotent when the account row is already
absent.

For requests carrying `operationId`, the Connector persists only the random operation ID, opaque
account ID, state, and timestamps. It does not retain the Signal address after account deletion.
At most 256 completed operations are retained; one unfinished operation is allowed per account. On a
later explicit user retry, an unfinished operation first performs two read-only `listAccounts`
checks. If both confirm that the account is absent, the Connector atomically completes its local
cleanup without issuing a second delete; otherwise that user action may dispatch the delete again.

The Connector does not retry `deleteLocalAccountData` automatically. If signal-cli returns a
definitive failure, local rows remain unchanged. If the process, transport, or timeout makes the
result unknowable, the response is `ACCOUNT_DELETE_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` with `retryable=false` and local
rows also remain. KT keeps the binding and the same `operationId`; only a new explicit user action may
repeat the idempotent exit operation. This avoids both silent local data loss and background repeats
of a destructive operation.

### 6.3 Receive

```text
signal-cli receive notification
  -> bounded JSON parser
  -> schema validation
  -> normalize + stable message ID
  -> SQLite transaction + dedupe
  -> bounded event queue
  -> KT event
```

Persistence happens before event delivery so KT reloads recover facts from the store.

### 6.4 Send

Every send has a KT `clientRequestId`. The connector inserts a pending record before calling
signal-cli. A repeated request returns the same local record. Timeout or child death after dispatch
produces `unknown`; it never automatically sends again.

AI-generated and human messages use the same send method. Language policy and tenant capability are
enforced by KT before the connector call, while connector ownership and idempotency checks remain
mandatory.

### 6.5 History limitation

The connector only promises history it has persisted. `sendSyncRequest` can synchronize contacts and
groups but is not treated as complete phone/Desktop message-history backfill. Product UI must not
promise pre-link history until a separately verified upstream capability exists.

### 6.6 Media limitation

Phase 1 runs signal-cli with attachments, stories, and stickers ignored. Current signal-cli downloads
non-ignored incoming attachments before it emits the receive notification, and `getAttachment`
returns an already-downloaded file as full Base64. That is not an acceptable large-media boundary.

Media remains disabled until a dedicated PoC proves bounded disk-pressure behavior and streams a
canonical, already-downloaded file through a short-lived handle without Base64 or arbitrary path
exposure. Failure to prove the limit leaves the media capability disabled.

## 7. Data and Resource Limits

### 7.1 Data ownership

| Data | Owner | Cleanup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signal keys and protocol account DB | signal-cli private data directory | explicit destructive action only |
| normalized messages, conversations, contacts, cursors | connector SQLite | product retention policy |
| current 100-200 message window | KT UI | release on navigation/unmount |
| media cache | connector | TTL/LRU after media approval |
| link URI | connector memory | timeout/cancel immediately |

The signal-cli data directory is never a cache and must be explicitly excluded from cleanup code.

### 7.2 Memory budget before measurement

| Component | Idle RSS | Active text RSS | Media transient RSS |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| signal-cli JVM/native | 140-280 MB | 200-400 MB | 300-600 MB |
| Rust connector | 8-25 MB | 15-40 MB | 20-60 MB |
| KT Signal gateway/UI/cache increment | 20-70 MB | 35-110 MB | 60-150 MB |
| total Signal increment | 170-350 MB | 250-550 MB | 400-800 MB |

These are capacity budgets, not measurements or promises. Phase 3 records actual process RSS on each
target platform and replaces the estimates.

Additional idle account budget: 20-80 MB while sharing the same JVM. An ordinary open text
conversation should normally remain below 1-5 MB incremental UI state, with an acceptance hard limit
of 20 MB relative to the Signal idle baseline.

Initial JVM budget starts at `-Xms16m -Xmx384m`. JVM heap is not total RSS. Sustained idle Signal
increment above 350 MB or monotonic growth triggers profiling rather than a documentation increase.

### 7.3 Bounded structures

- host frame: default 1 MiB, configurable only downward in production policy.
- signal-cli line: default 8 MiB for text PoC; media does not use this path.
- host connections: one authenticated KT main process in Phase 1.
- pending host requests: 128 global, 32 per account, and 8 MiB aggregate request bytes per
  authenticated connection.
- authenticated host dispatch: control 1, link wait 1, persisted reads 4, sends 2; sends remain
  ordered per account and responses are correlated by `requestId`, not arrival order. The link-wait
  lane admits at most one `link.finish` and is independent from link cancellation and lifecycle
  control.
- pending signal-cli requests: 128 global.
- event queue: 1,024 normalized events with pressure reporting.
- current message page: default 100, maximum 200.
- conversation cursors are opaque keyset cursors over `(last_message_at nullness,
  last_message_at, id)`; message cursors are exact message IDs over `(sent_at, id)`. Unknown or
  cross-account cursors fail closed instead of silently returning the first page.
- reconnect attempts: exponential backoff with a circuit breaker.

Core persistence must not be dropped under event pressure. Non-critical enrichment is disabled first.

## 8. Security and Privacy

- Owner-only endpoint, secret file, account data, SQLite, and diagnostic directories.
- No secret in command-line arguments, environment logs, telemetry, or crash reports.
- Runtime schema and length validation at every IPC and JSON-RPC boundary.
- Canonical-path checks for every approved attachment file handle.
- No message body, contact, phone number, QR payload, token, key path, or raw envelope in logs.
- Metrics use opaque account IDs, method categories, sizes, durations, result classes, and trace IDs.
- Connector API is default deny; a manifest capability does not authorize an operation by itself.
- Deleting local account data is separate from unlinking and requires explicit confirmation in KT.

## 9. Licensing and Distribution

- This connector is AGPL-3.0-only and remains an independent executable.
- signal-cli remains an independent, unmodified GPLv3 executable.
- libsignal remains under Signal's AGPLv3 license inside the signal-cli runtime boundary.
- KT Desktop does not copy or link connector, signal-cli, or libsignal code.
- The host protocol is public, versioned, general-purpose, and does not exchange internal language
  objects or shared memory.

Every binary release must include or provide equivalent access to the exact corresponding source,
build scripts, license texts, notices, SBOM, source commits, hashes, and patch list for all covered
components. Pointing only to a moving upstream branch is insufficient. Phase 1 patch lists must be
empty for signal-cli and libsignal.

This code license does not grant Signal service, API, trademark, or partnership authorization. The
product must describe the integration as unofficial and separately review Signal service terms,
automated messaging behavior, account suspension, and compatibility risk.

## 10. Phases and Exit Criteria

### Phase 0: repository and delivery contract

Deliver:

- Rust project, AGPL license, NOTICE, README, agent rules, and this plan.
- local build, format, test, clippy, and release build.
- local commit only.

Exit: a clean review finds no contract contradiction, secret, unrelated file, or build failure.

### Phase 1: process and protocol PoC

Deliver:

- authenticated private IPC on the current platform with platform abstractions.
- bounded host framing and API handshake.
- signal-cli child process supervisor and bounded JSON-RPC transport.
- runtime status/start/stop and normalized receive events.
- fake signal-cli integration fixture covering success, malformed output, timeout, crash, restart,
  shutdown, duplicate ID, and unknown send outcome.

Exit: fmt, unit/integration tests, clippy, release build, clean review, and local commit.

The macOS implementation and tests use a private Unix socket. The Windows named-pipe module must be
implemented and tested on Windows before Phase 3 packaging; a platform abstraction alone is not a
claim that the Windows transport has passed acceptance.

### Phase 2: account linking and text channel

Deliver:

- start/finish/cancel link state with expiry and zeroization.
- account list and account-ID mapping.
- normalized direct/group text events and text send.
- SQLite schema, migrations, stable IDs, dedupe, pagination, unread, and client-request idempotency.

Exit: fake integration coverage plus a separately authorized real-account test. No real-account result
may be inferred from a fixture.

### Phase 3: packaging and resource baseline

Deliver:

- signed connector, signal-cli, and JRE manifests for Windows x64 and macOS x64/arm64.
- exact source archive, LICENSE/NOTICE/SBOM, hashes, and reproducible build record.
- LKG stage/activate/rollback.
- idle, active text, restart, 24-hour, and multi-account resource reports.

Exit: target-platform resource gates and license delivery review pass.

### Phase 4: KT Desktop integration

Local integration status (2026-08-09): merged in the separate `kt-desktop` worktree on
`codex/signal-test-main-latest` at `5e18793c`. This does not satisfy the remaining Windows,
signed-distribution, 24/72-hour, or real multi-account production gates.

Deliver in KT Desktop:

- ConnectorSupervisor and connector client.
- native Signal account/conversation/message/composer UI.
- AI language policy, translation, remarks, and quick replies through the shared send path.
- tenant gray rollout and diagnostics.

Exit: desktop contract, integration, actual UI, and target-platform acceptance pass.

### Phase 5: optional media

Deliver only when proven:

- bounded incoming download and disk-pressure behavior.
- streaming file handles without Base64 or arbitrary paths.
- cache cleanup, cancellation, low-disk, and large-file tests.

Exit: resource/security review. Otherwise media remains disabled.

### Phase 6: optional Feature Host

This phase requires evidence of independent release, third-party extension, or fault-isolation need.
It reuses the connector and signal-cli processes and adds a bounded Feature Host pool; it never starts
one worker per conversation or one JVM per account.

## 11. Review Gates

Every phase follows:

```text
implement
  -> focused tests
  -> integration/build checks
  -> security/concurrency/resource review
  -> minimal fixes
  -> retest
  -> rereview
  -> local commit
```

Review priority:

1. wrong-account/wrong-recipient actions, key exposure, arbitrary execution, path traversal, data loss.
2. duplicate sends, unknown-send retry, races, deadlocks, orphan processes, unbounded memory/disk.
3. contract drift, malformed upstream data, restart behavior, diagnostics, missing tests.
4. maintainability and clarity that prevent future boundary mistakes.

No push, remote repository creation, release, deployment, or external message is part of these phases
without separate authorization.
